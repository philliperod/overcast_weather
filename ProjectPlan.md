# Overcast Weather App

## Components:

### Navbar

- I want to submit zip code
- I want the current date

### CurrentLocation

- I want to take the zip code submission and provide current weather
- I want current location
- I want current temperature
- I want current weather description
- I want next 4 hour weather timeline

### Radar

- I want title
- I want current location
- I want current location map

### FiveDays

- I want current day with temperature, description, and icon to match
- I want the next 4 days with same features

## Workflow

1.  I want the navbar to display the current date and have an input field with a submit button.
2.  I want to enter and submit a zip code in the navbar.
3.  I want that submission to be passed into the Current component that will use the Open Weather API to fetch data and return weather info.
4.  I want that info to populate in all three components - Current, Radar, and FiveDays
5.  I want to be able to cancel/remove the weather card from a small icon located on the top right of the card.
6.  I want to additional cards to pop up from the bottom of page.
7.  I want the navbar to stay static on top of the page.
